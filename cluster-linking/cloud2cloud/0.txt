In this demonstration, we'll establish a cluster link between two
clusters in Confluent Cloud. We'll identify one cluster as a primary
and one cluster as a secondary, or DR, cluster. 

We'll mirror relevant data over the link including topics, ACLs,
and consumer group offsets. 

We'll follow the best practices for role based access control in Confluent
Cloud. 

We'll invoke an outage on the primary cluster, using a failover command to
convert our mirrored topics to regular topics. Then we'll move consumers
and producers over to the recovery cluster to continue operations.

REQUIRED:
-Create two clusters in Confluent Cloud, a source cluster and a 
recovery cluster. The source cluster can be basic or better. The
recovery cluster must be dedicated.

-Configure the confluent cloud CLI following the directions provided
for Confluent Cloud
