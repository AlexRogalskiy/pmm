First, create two clusters in Confluent Cloud: the primary cluster
and the DR cluster. You can use the Confluent Cloud UI or the Confluent
Cloud CLI for this.

The DR cluster should be a Dedicated cluster with public internet endpoints.

The primary cluster can be any type of cluster. To properly simulate a
zone outage, it should be a different availability zone as the DR cluster.

Once the clusters are created, continue and we will collect the required
information.
